\arguments{
\item{exprsMat_train}{A matrix of expression matrix of reference dataset}

\item{cellTypes_train}{A vector of cell types of reference dataset}

\item{exprsMat_test}{A list or a matrix indicates the expression matrices of the query datasets}

\item{cellTypes_test}{A list or a vector indicates cell types of the query datasets (Optional).}

\item{tree}{A vector indicates the method to build hierarchical tree, set as "HOPACH" by default.
This should be one of "HOPACH" and "HC" (using hclust).}

\item{algorithm}{A vector indicates the KNN method that are used, set as "WKNN" by default. This
should be one or more of "WKNN", "KNN", "DWKNN".}

\item{selectFeatures}{A vector indicates the gene selection method, set as "limma" by default.
This should be one or more of "limma", "DV", "DD", "chisq", "BI".}

\item{similarity}{A vector indicates the similarity measure that are used, set as "pearson" by default.
This should be one or more of "pearson",  "spearman", "cosine", "jaccard", "kendall", "binomial", "weighted_rank","manhattan"}

\item{cutoff_method}{A vector indicates the method to cutoff the correlation distribution. Set as "dynamic" by default.}

\item{weighted_ensemble}{A logical input indicates in ensemble learning, whether the results is combined by a
weighted score for each base classifier.}

\item{weighted_jointClassification}{A logical input indicates in joint classification using multiple training datasets,
whether the results is combined by a weighted score for each training model.}

\item{cellType_tree}{A list indicates the cell type tree provided by user. (By default, it is NULL) (Only for one training data input)}

\item{k}{An integer indicates the number of neighbour}

\item{topN}{An integer indicates the top number of features that are selected}

\item{hopach_kmax}{An integer between 1 and 9 specifying the maximum number of
children at each node in the HOPACH tree.}

\item{pSig}{A numeric indicates the cutoff of pvalue for features}

\item{prob_threshold}{A numeric indicates the probability threshold for KNN/WKNN/DWKNN.}

\item{cor_threshold_static}{A numeric indicates the static correlation threshold.}

\item{cor_threshold_high}{A numeric indicates the highest correlation threshold}

\item{returnList}{A logical input indicates whether the output will be class of list}

\item{parallel}{A logical input indicates whether running in paralllel or not}

\item{ncores}{An integer indicates the number of cores that are used}

\item{verbose}{A logical input indicates whether the intermediate steps will be printed}
